title: "Threads in JavaScript: yes it can"
---

*This is work in progress - I'm still working on the last two sections.*

In the context of mainstream JavaScript, multithreading often gets to
play the [bogeyman]'s role: Whenever somebody starts complaining about the
pains of callback-based asynchronous programming, chances are that triggers
someone else to cast the grim picture of deadlocks and race conditions that
come with threads. The conclusion then is usually that callbacks are the lesser
evil, or maybe that coroutines or actors are the way to go, but unfortunately
aren't available in JavaScript today. (Actually, coroutines are part of JS 1.7
and scheduled for inclusion ES Harmony in the form of [generators] - yay!)

Not that this picture is completely wrong. Threads *are* [tricky] when
combined with shared mutable data. If you think you can master them then you
probably haven't done a lot of it. I've done some over the years, and it makes
Erlang with its actor based message passing, lightweight processes, and
immutable data look quite attractive. Clojure and Scala have both been very
successful in bringing different aspects of Erlang to the JVM.
For JavaScript, the mainstream programming model has been event-based single
threaded operation, which makes perfect sense for clients, and is fine for
servers with low or medium workload.

The problems with single threaded event loops (and similarly, purely
cooperative multithreading) on the server start to show when concurrency
increases. Humans just make for lousy schedulers, and once you have
hundreds or thousands of requests going on at the same time this will show in
[increased latency] and [reduced throughput]. If you want to write a server
that performs well under these conditions, you
really want to [use both] preemptive multithreading *and* nonblocking I/O. (And
no, I don't think preemptive scheduling *outside* the core server process
will do.)

So preemtive threading does provide great performance characteristics that
are hard to get with any other means. But then JavaScript spoils it with its
mutable data, right? Well it's actually not that bad. Having worked on and
with multithreaded server-side JavaScript for 10+ years, here are two points
I'd like to make:

1. Threads are not evil (or even difficult), shared memory locking is.

2. Depending on coding style and environment, multithreaded JavaScript can
   range from piece of cake to arcane science.

The following is based on actual implementation of and experience with threads
in [Rhino] and [Ringo], but parts of it could apply to any multithreaded
JavaScript engine. Let's start with the good parts first.

## The good: functional == lockless

The great news is that if you write your programs in a functional style, you
may never have to worry about concurrency problems at all. Functional in this
context means that your functions should not rely on mutable shared state and thus
be free of [side effects]. Let's repeat this, because it's really cool:
If you program functionally you get all the benefits of multithreading such
as real concurrency and scaling across processor cores without any of the
downsides, such as race conditions or locking.

Fortunately JavaScript supports functional, side-effect free
programming pretty well. Unfortunately, the exact opposite is just as true.
Ringo improves this a bit by getting the global object [out of the scope chain]
and thus out of the way of the programmer. The only
way in Ringo to set a global variable is by directly assigning to the `global`
property.

Let's look at a typical [JSGI] module that will run multi-threaded on Ringo:

{% highlight javascript %}
var response = require("ringo/jsgi/response");
var mustache = require("ringo/mustache");

exports.index = function(req) {
    return responseHelper("./templates/welcome.html",
        {title: "Hello World!"});
}

function responseHelper(template, context) {
    var temp = getResource(template).getContent();
    return response.html(mustache.to_html(temp, context));
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, the only thing declared outside the `index` and helper functions
(and thus the only thing that is shared between threads) are the module import
statements. If these modules are thread-safe as they should be (ideally by
using the same functional style of programming), your whole application will.
You could easily move read-only data such as the cached template
content out into shared scope without any worries.

Now JavaScript is not a purely functional language. Eventually, you'll either
need to have shared mutable state, or you'll want to use closures, which are
functions that share outside state. I'll look at these cases in the following
two sections.

## The bad: closures == shared state

*coming soon*

## The safe way to share state
