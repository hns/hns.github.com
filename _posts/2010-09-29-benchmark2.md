title: "Update on my Node.js Memory and GC Benchmark"
---

I was lucky enough to have a short chat with [Ryan] at JSConf.eu last weekend
in Berlin about the [memory allocation comparison] between [Node.js] and
[RingoJS] I had done. He didn't have any suggestion for tuning Node.js or V8 for
higher memory and garbage collector throughput, but thought it was possible
that Node's lackluster performance in the benchmark had to do with binary
buffers and getting data in and out of them.

Thinking about a memory and garbage collection benchmark that didn't involve
buffers quickly led me to JSON. Parsing JSON is a fairly frequent task
for a web application, and it can put a considerable load on the garbage
collector. Also, from my work on the Rhino JSON parser I knew that it is
comparable in speed to V8's (something that unfortunately isn't true of, say,
RegExp implementations), so the results would reflect GC performance
pretty well.

[Here's the source code][json-benchmark] of the JSON parsing benchmark I wrote.
Basically it builds a ~25kb JSON string at startup that is parsed once for
each request. The JSON string consists of an object with 100 child objects,
each of which contain 10 short string properties.

The results I got reinforce those of the
[other benchmarks][memory allocation comparison], with Node.js scoring
`495` requests per second and RingoJS `1116`. This is even more noteworthy
as it builds on a Hello-World HTTP benchmark where Node clearly outperforms
Ringo!

At this point, I can't think of any other conclusion than V8's garbage collector
not being tuned for this kind of workload. Still, if you think there's something
to boost Node's performance in this benchmark that I didn't know about please
let me know by posting a comment below.
