# About Me

<img src="/images/hv.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 2em;">

My name is Hannes Wallnöfer. You can reach me at <a href='&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#x3a;&#104;&#097;&#110;&#110;&#101;&#115;&#119;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;'>&#104;&#097;&#110;&#110;&#101;&#115;&#119;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>.

I grew up in a [small town][meran] in northern Italy and then spent most of my
adult years in [Vienna], Austria. Currently I live in a village in the very
south of Austria close to the Italian and Slovenian borders with my partner and
two kids.

I've been doing server-side JavaScript for many years, most of which I spent
working on [Helma]. At some point, Helma started to feel too rigid for being
taught new tricks. Hence the project that eventually became [Ringo] was born.
Today I work mainly on Ringo, so most of this blog will center on it in one way
or the other.

When I started Helma I was mostly a Java developer. Like everybody else, it took
me several years to understand and appreciate the elegance of JavaScript. Today,
I usually prefer writing JS over Java, although I still love working on the
[JVM].

# About this Site

My goal with this site is to provide detailed, close-up descriptions of specific
aspects of Ringo and the technologies surrounding it. This kind of positive,
in-depth coverage (call it evangelism if you like) is something that has been
missing for Helma, and I feel like I ought to do better this time around.

The tools I'm using for this site are [Jekyll] and [Markdown]. I've been
blogging in one way or the other since 1998, but I've rarely managed to go
beyond two or three paragraphs in length. I find that writing inside a browser
textarea just sucks, especially when using raw HTML links. (This was probably
made worse by the fact that from the beginning, I used self-coded weblog
software lacking any drafting functionality at all.) Jekyll and Markdown finally
make editing web site content bearable for me!

# About the Beetle

The animal on top of this page is a [Japanese Rhinoceros Beetle][rhino beetle]
or _Kabutomushi_ (カブトムシ). Apparently, these bugs are kept as pets in Japan and
other parts of eastern Asia.

My original intent for this site was to call it _Rhino Beetle_ or something
(alluding to both [Rhino] and [Ringo]). Instead I decided to just set up a
simple unbranded github page, but I kept the beetle image because it's such an
amazing animal.

The photo is from [this site](http://godofinsects.com/museum/display.php?sid=182)
and was taken by [Barbara Strnadova](http://dova-imagery.com). If you live near
NYC and happen need a photographer please check her out!
